  <b> My emacs configurations </b>
</p>

# To be noted
- It's based on my taste and most installed packages came from [awesome-emacs](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#interface-enhancement)
- Please make sure you read and understand well what you are doing ( MEANS DON'T COPY PASTE what you don't know )
- Feel free to read the emacs wiki to understand better their philosophy, emacs is more than a text editor after all.

# Installation
- I have written my config in [org-mode](https://emacs.christianbaeuerlein.com/my-org-config.html#orgc3bc9b5), you probably want to do same, in order to take proper notes.
- Copy the init.el into your .emacs.d/ inside your home directory and read the config.org carefully, I have put notes and explainations inside it.
- In case of any issues or doutes, please refer to the emacs wiki or [awesome-emacs](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#interface-enhancement)

# TODO or maybe NEVER
- Explain emacs basic, like what is buffer and different modes and what M-x or C-c stand for.
- Clean up the config.org
- Write cleaner installation instructions...
