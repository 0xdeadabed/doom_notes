  <b> My emacs configurations </b>
</p>

# To be noted
- It's based on my taste and most installed packages came from [awesome-emacs](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#interface-enhancement)
- Please make sure you read and understand well what you are doing ( MEANS DON'T COPY PASTE what you don't know )
- Feel free to read the emacs wiki to understand better their philosophy, emacs is more than a text editor after all.


# Installation
- I have written my config in [org-mode](https://emacs.christianbaeuerlein.com/my-org-config.html#orgc3bc9b5), you probably want to do same, in order to take proper notes.
- Copy the init.el into your .emacs.d/ inside your home directory and read the config.org carefully, I have put notes and explainations inside it.
- In case of any issues or doutes, please refer to the emacs wiki or [awesome-emacs](https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs#interface-enhancement)

# Emacs basics

Welcome to emacs, subjectively the best editor ever, it's more than just a text editor though...

* C-x C-c -> To close emacs, in case of any modification, it would pop a message and ask you if you want to save the buffer y/n.
* C-x C-s -> To save the current buffer.
* C-s -> To search for a word.

* Shift+arrows-keys ->  To navigate between buffers(windows).
* C-c k -> To kill the current window.
* C-c 0 -> To close the current window.
* C-c 1 -> To close other widnows.

# TODO or maybe NEVER

- Emacs basics.
- Explain emacs basic, like what is buffer and different modes and what M-x or C-c stand for.
- Clean up the config.org
- Write cleaner installation instructions...
